The Writing Task 2 of the IELTS test requires you to write at least 250 words. You will be presented with a topic and will be tested on your ability to respond by giving and justifying an opinion, discussing the topic, summarizing details, outlining problems, identifying possible solutions and supporting what you write with reasons, arguments and relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
It is particularly important in writing task 2 to display clear thinking and organization. You should go through the processes you have been practising, taking notes and organizing your writing but in addition you should remember to:
- have a clear introduction telling the reader briefly what areas you are going to cover;
- make it clear which side of an argument you are presenting (use clear linking expressions such as 'On the one hand ... On the other hand') and make sure you do not mix two sides of an argument in the same paragraph;
- give examples clearly (choose good examples which illustrate your argument when you take notes, and when you write introduce them with phrases such as 'We can see an example of this ... ');
- make it clear when you are giving your own opinion (use expressions such as 'in my view ... ');
- give a clear conclusion which relates your argument back to the original question/s and summarises your opinion.
